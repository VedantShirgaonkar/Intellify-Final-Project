# ✋🤖 AI Powered Real-Time Sign Language Translator  

### Bridging Communication Gaps – Seamless Translation Between Sign Language and Text/Speech  

---

## 📖 Why This Project?  

Communication barriers between **sign language users** and **non-signers** make accessibility a challenge in education, workplaces, and daily interactions.  
Existing solutions are either **limited in vocabulary**, **require heavy internet access**, or **fail to work in real-time**.  

Our project aims to solve this by building a **real-time, AI-powered sign language translator** that is:  

- **Real-Time & Offline** – Works seamlessly without constant internet.  
- **Video-to-Text Translation** – Converts sign language gestures into accurate text.  
- **Text-to-Sign Video** – Converts written text into sign language animations/videos.  
- **Adaptive Learning** – Continuously improves accuracy with training.  
- **Accessible UI** – Easy-to-use interface for both deaf and non-deaf users.
